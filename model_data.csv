Initial test,linear regression,Zillow and Fed Fund Data without Census data,0.999969638,"This proved our model would work, but relied on location information we wanted to remove so the model would be more adaptable"
Census and Zillow,linear regression,"Census, Zillow, and Fed Fund Data with Metro names removed",0.999563596,"Replaced location data with census data, so the model is able to work if given data for any given region. The model performance was still good and not requiring metro location makes the model more valuable."
