Initial test,linear regression,Zillow and Fed Fund Data without Census data,0.999969638,"This proved our model would work, but relied on location information we wanted to remove so the model would be more adaptable"
Census and Zillow,linear regression,"Census ACS Flow & 5-Year, Zillow, and Fed Fund Data with the identifying Metro names removed",0.999563596,"Replaced the one-hot encoded location identifier data with census data, so the model is able to work if given data for any given region. The model performance was still good and not requiring metro location makes the model more valuable."
Census and Zillow,linear regression,"cleaned the Census data further to remove columns that might be duplicates of each other (i.e. poverty count & poverty rate, racial demographics count and rate)",0.998842704,removing features that might be collinear or having an outsized effect
Census and Zillow,linear regression,scaled data ,0.99905588,"the numeric data was naturally existing on varying scales: 100,000s for ZHVI ($) & Population figures to percentage rates for Census Data and Fed Fund Data figures. Data was scaled so that the larger #s would not have an outsized effect on the result"
Census and Zillow,linear regression,added additional columns for unoccupied housing rate and median family income (from Census) for each location  ,0.999242961,continued the search through the Census API for additional factors known to affect the housing market  
Census and Zillow,linear regression,dropped ACS Net Migration column (the limiting factor in # of data points joined) in order to increase # of data points model is learning on ,0.999920611,The dataset we had been testing on was a little over 200 records after joining the data we had found. We wanted to increase our sample size to get a more robust model learning process. The ACS Flow dataset was the smallest of the 3 thereby limiting how big the datset could ever be. Removing this data from our combined dataset more than doubled the amount of available data able to be joined by location.
